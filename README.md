# Active & Passive Filter Design

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the design and implementation of **Active and Passive Filters** using **Operational Amplifiers (Op-Amps)** and passive components in Analog Electronics. The primary goal is to enhance signal processing by selectively allowing desired frequency components while attenuating unwanted noise.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design and analyze **Low-Pass, High-Pass, Band-Pass, and Band-Stop filters** using both active and passive components.
- Optimize filter performance based on **cutoff frequency, gain, and quality factor (Q-factor).**
- Implement and test the circuit using **LTSpice** for simulation and hardware prototypes.

## 🔧 Components & Tools
### Hardware:
- Operational Amplifiers (**TL074, LM741, or equivalent**)
- Resistors and Capacitors (selected based on filter specifications)
- Inductors (for passive filter design)
- DC Power Supply
- Function Generator
- Oscilloscope
- Breadboard & Connecting Wires

### Software:
- **LTSpice** (for circuit simulation)

## 🔍 Filter Design Considerations
- **Filter Type:** Active vs. Passive
- **Filter Order:** Determines the sharpness of the cutoff.
- **Cutoff Frequency (fc):** Defines the boundary between passband and stopband.
- **Gain (Av):** Controls signal amplification in active filters.
- **Q-Factor:** Impacts selectivity in Band-Pass and Band-Stop filters.

## ⚙️ Circuit Implementations
1. **Low-Pass Filter (LPF)** – Allows low frequencies and attenuates high frequencies.
2. **High-Pass Filter (HPF)** – Allows high frequencies and attenuates low frequencies.
3. **Band-Pass Filter (BPF)** – Passes frequencies within a specific range.
4. **Band-Stop Filter (BSF)** – Attenuates a specific frequency band while passing others.

## 📊 Simulation & Results
- Frequency Response (Bode Plot) comparison with theoretical values.
- Phase Response Analysis.
- Practical implementation vs. simulated results using **LTSpice**.

## 🏆 Key Learnings & Challenges
- Effects of real-world components on filter performance.
- Importance of Op-Amp selection in active filter stability.
- Noise considerations and mitigation techniques.
- Differences in performance between active and passive filters.
